08-Map-Tiles

Definitions : Maps folders are located in Campaign foldersin in CampaignName/Maps/MapName.
The map's folder name must be the same as the map's name.
This folder contains several files.

map_info.json : contains very basic static map data like map name and default music.
	The map name must be the same as the folder's.
And, among others,  the one that contains the tile data, map_things.json.

A default Realmz map is 90x90 tiles.

01-Creating a map in Tiled :

Open your tilesets in other  tabs to access them in your Tile Map. You can mix several tilesets this way.
RealmzRemake also supports layers.


Likely issues :

In Tiled, do not forget to set  all height and width CUSTOM properties to your  map's dimensions.
In map_things.json, this should appear as :
"height":90,
"width":90,
Also, the tileset sources should be set to just the name of the tileset, not the path.
         "source":"ForestDay.json"
To ensure that, when building the map in Tiled you can place your tileset and tilemap files in the same folder.
