FOR IMAGE STORAGE :

In 3.0, you can create a PoolByteArray the same way you build a Vector2, Color or Rect2:
var array = PoolByteArray()  Beware though, these use copy-on-write, unlike arrays made with [].

TRAITS :  in item files, if a trait name ends with .gd it shares for a standard Trait in the shared assets filder inside realmz. in chara file, same, and they dont need source.

var specialskills : Array = ["Melee_Crit_Rate","Melee_Crit_Mult","Ranged_Crit_Rate","Ranged_Crit_Mult","Detect_Secret","Acrobatics","Detect_Trap","Disable_Trap","Force_Lock","Pick_Lock","Turn_Undead"]


> important  :  reinstall Mod Player from  Asset Store before building.

Then I should be ready to start working on combat. Someday.


I don't know if I will create a menu to select the music you want or if I'll just let you move and rename the files, though.
Mouse control for map !
Then I will make a thing that keeps track of the time. It will be used very often for things like HP/MP regeneration, status conditions and calling other scripts.
Then I will finish character creation (the menu is almost empty for now) and data, then probably save/load game...
What has slowed me down for the characters part is that I am STILL not sure what stats we will keep/remove/add. The exact stats for each class/race can always be tweaked later.
Then I will make scripts for the exploration mode (which includes staus conditions) . They are not as complicated as combat scripts. I hope Francisco's advice and comments will be enough to guide me !
Next will come items and spells...
The Combat mode will come when I'm done with everything else, including the user interface. I already made a turn based top view combat system before, so I'm not too worried about that part.
